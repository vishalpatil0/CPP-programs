/*
STL is standard template library 
which have
1) algorithm  like sort and search
        
2) containers like vectors
        object which stores data.
        
        Types
        a) Sequence Containers -- Stores data in linear fashion
            e.g. list, vector, dequeue

            Vector -- Random access fast
                    insertion deletion is slow
                    Insertion at the end fast

                    if it got full it will create new array and copy the element to it.

            List =  random access is slow
                    middle/end  insetion deletion is fast


        b) Associative containers -- direct access, fast deletion insertion. Stores data in tree like structures.

        = All operations are fast except Random Access
        
            e.g. set,multiset and dictionary, map and multimap



        c) Derived Containers -- Real world modelling
            e.g. stack and queue 

3) iterators  object for data traversing
