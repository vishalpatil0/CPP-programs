/*
In C++, string is an object of std::string class that represents sequence of characters. We can perform many operations on strings such as concatenation, comparison, conversion etc.


C++ provides following two types of string representations âˆ’

	-The C-style character string.
	-The string class type introduced with Standard C++.
