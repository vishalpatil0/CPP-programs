Stream is known as sequence of bytes.
Input stream is flow of bytes from input device to the main memory
Ouput Stream is the flow of bytes from main memory to the output device.


Insertion operator is <<

Extraction operator is >>



There are two types of header files
1)System header files : comes with the compiler
    syntax: #include<iostream.h>

2)User defined header files: written by the programmer
    syntax: #include "this.h"



typeid(variable_name).name() =====this prints the type of variable.


:: Scope Resolution operator



Manipulators are those who maipulates the flow of bytes.
header file is iomanip
1. endl
2. setw



Control Sturctures types:
1. sequence Sturctures ==  sequence by sequence execution
2. selection Sturctures ==  if else and switch
3. loop structures ==  loops 

we can also use the prinft and scanf function in c++

Function prototypng is nothing but declaring function before using.

we can't declare same variable twice in the same scope 
but we can declare it multiple times in different scopes.


In c and c++ if if-else and loops dont have curly brackets then the first statment after them get executed.

By adding semicolon at the end of for loop like
for( ; ; );   just like it 
it only loop for given condition but it will not execute and block or any statement below it it is something like self execution loop.

and also for if else
if there is semicolon at the end of if statment then it became self executing loop

if(condition); 

it will not execute below code but will execute the condition in it.
